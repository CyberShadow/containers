<table>
<tr><td>numOwns</td><td></td><td>Counts the number of calls to .</td></tr><tr><td>numAllocate</td><td></td><td>Counts the number of calls to . All calls are counted,
   including requests for zero bytes or failed requests.</td></tr><tr><td>numAllocateOK</td><td></td><td>Counts the number of calls to  that succeeded, i.e. they were
   for more than zero bytes and returned a non-null block.</td></tr><tr><td>numExpand</td><td></td><td>Counts the number of calls to , regardless of arguments or
   result.</td></tr><tr><td>numExpandOK</td><td></td><td>Counts the number of calls to  that resulted in a successful
   expansion.</td></tr><tr><td>numReallocate</td><td></td><td>Counts the number of calls to , regardless of arguments or
   result.</td></tr><tr><td>numReallocateOK</td><td></td><td>Counts the number of calls to  that succeeded. (Reallocations
   to zero bytes count as successful.)</td></tr><tr><td>numReallocateInPlace</td><td></td><td>Counts the number of calls to  that resulted in an in-place
   reallocation (no memory moved). If this number is close to the total number
   of reallocations, that indicates the allocator finds room at the current
   block's end in a large fraction of the cases, but also that internal
   fragmentation may be high (the size of the unit of allocation is large
   compared to the typical allocation size of the application).</td></tr><tr><td>numDeallocate</td><td></td><td>Counts the number of calls to .</td></tr><tr><td>numDeallocateAll</td><td></td><td>Counts the number of calls to .</td></tr><tr><td>numAll</td><td></td><td>Chooses all  flags.</td></tr><tr><td>bytesAllocated</td><td></td><td>Tracks total cumulative bytes allocated by means of ,
   , and  (when resulting in an expansion). This
   number always grows and indicates allocation traffic. To compute bytes
   currently allocated, subtract  (below) from
   .</td></tr><tr><td>bytesDeallocated</td><td></td><td>Tracks total cumulative bytes deallocated by means of  and
    (when resulting in a contraction). This number always grows
   and indicates deallocation traffic.</td></tr><tr><td>bytesExpanded</td><td></td><td>Tracks the sum of all  values in calls of the form
    that succeed (return ).</td></tr><tr><td>bytesContracted</td><td></td><td>Tracks the sum of all  with  in calls of
   the form  that succeed (return ).</td></tr><tr><td>bytesMoved</td><td></td><td>Tracks the sum of all bytes moved as a result of calls to  that
   were unable to reallocate in place. A large number (relative to ) indicates that the application should use larger
   preallocations.</td></tr><tr><td>bytesSlack</td><td></td><td>Measures the sum of extra bytes allocated beyond the bytes requested, i.e.
   the . This is the current
   effective number of slack bytes, and it goes up and down with time.</td></tr><tr><td>bytesHighTide</td><td></td><td>Measures the maximum bytes allocated over the time. This is useful for
   dimensioning allocators.</td></tr><tr><td>bytesAll</td><td></td><td>Chooses all  flags.</td></tr><tr><td>callerSize</td><td></td><td>Instructs  to store the size asked by the caller for
   each allocation. All per-allocation data is stored just before the actually
   allocation (see ).</td></tr><tr><td>callerModule</td><td></td><td>Instructs  to store the caller module for each
   allocation.</td></tr><tr><td>callerFile</td><td></td><td>Instructs  to store the caller's file for each
   allocation.</td></tr><tr><td>callerFunction</td><td></td><td>Instructs  to store the caller  for
   each allocation.</td></tr><tr><td>callerLine</td><td></td><td>Instructs  to store the caller's line for each
   allocation.</td></tr><tr><td>callerTime</td><td></td><td>Instructs  to store the time of each allocation.</td></tr><tr><td>callerAll</td><td></td><td>Chooses all  flags.</td></tr><tr><td>all</td><td></td><td>Combines all flags above.</td></tr></table>
